# About

This is a show case for [SuperTest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest). Each module contains some code with an error, a controller unit test, and a SuperTest integration test.
These demos are meant to demonstrate the shortcomings of unit tests, as each unit test is missing the respective error in the code. These demos, even though simplified, are based on real-life examples and are meant to show real problems.

Try to find the error in the code or unit test on your own before checking out the integration test!

# Setup

1. Copy `.env.dist` to `.env`
2. Run `npm run dev` or `npm run test`

There is also a postman collection in `postman.json` that can be used for manual testing.
